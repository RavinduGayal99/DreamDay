Case Study: DreamDay - Wedding Planner web Application
------------------------------------------------------
DreamDay is a high-end wedding planning service that aims to provide couples with a seamless 
platform for organizing their weddings. DreamDay is looking to develop a comprehensive online 
wedding planner application to help couples plan their special day by choosing venues, hiring vendors, 
managing guest lists, and tracking the progress of their wedding preparations. Additionally, the platform 
should offer wedding planners the ability to manage multiple weddings, communicate with clients, and 
generate reports.

Requirements for the System
---------------------------

User Registration and Login
---------------------------
Implement a secure registration and login system that allows couples and wedding planners to create 
accounts. Couples can manage their wedding plans, while wedding planners can manage multiple 
weddings and interact with clients.

Wedding Planning Dashboard
--------------------------
Design a dashboard that gives couples an overview of their wedding planning progress. The dashboard 
should display key information such as to-do lists, budget, and important dates.

Venue and Vendor Catalog
------------------------
Provide a catalog where couples can browse and select wedding venues, photographers, florists, 
caterers, and other vendors. Each vendor should include detailed information, such as services offered, 
pricing, and reviews.

Customizable Wedding Checklist
------------------------------
Offer a customizable wedding checklist that covers all the necessary tasks, from booking venues to 
selecting invitations. Couples should be able to add, remove, or edit tasks as needed.

Guest List Management
---------------------
Develop a feature for couples to create, manage, and organize their guest lists. Include functionalities 
such as tracking RSVPs, meal preferences, and seating arrangements.

Budget Tracker
--------------
Implement a budget tracking feature where couples can allocate funds for different aspects of their 
wedding (venue, catering, etc.), track expenses, and receive notifications if they exceed the budget.

Timeline Management
-------------------                                                                                               
Allow couples to set up a wedding day timeline, including ceremony start times, vendor arrival times, 
and other critical events to ensure the day runs smoothly.

Planner Interface
-----------------
Build a specialized interface for wedding planners to manage multiple weddings at once. Planners 
should be able to communicate with couples, update checklists, track vendor availability, and handle 
logistics.

Reporting and Analytics
-----------------------
Provide reporting features for wedding planners to analyze trends such as popular venues, average 
budgets, and vendor performance. Planners can use these insights to improve their services.

Admin Dashboard
---------------
Create an admin interface for system administrators to manage user accounts, monitor system usage, 
update vendor information, and generate various system reports.

Security and Data Protection
----------------------------
Implement strong security measures to protect user data, including secure authentication, encryption of 
sensitive information (e.g., payment data), and prevention of common security threats like SQL 
injection and cross-site scripting.
